Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language. 
It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA).
Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. 
The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities. 
It was released in May 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform.
